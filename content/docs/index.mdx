## What is Nexul UI?

Nexul UI is not another custom component library to showcase my desing skills. Rather, It is a collection of complex and reusable components that I once struggled to build for my own projects.

This library relies on [Shadcn UI's](https://ui.shadcn.com/) design system and distribution model. Therefore, it is recommended to have a basic understanding of Shadcn UI before using Nexul UI.

- It keeps all the codes in your project, so you have full control over the components and can easily customize them to fit your needs.
- It only solves complex UX problems, but styles aren't provided out of the box. You can add your own styles using Tailwind CSS or any other styling method you prefer.
- The bare minimum styles are kept to ensure the components are functional and accessible. Please refer to the specific docs, so that you don't miss any important styles required for proper functionality.

<Callout type="info" className="text-base" title="Note: Personal Project">
Nexul UI is not ment to be actively maintained or widely used. It is a personal project that I use for my own applications.
_You can use it without any restrictions, but please be aware that it may not receive regular updates or support._
In that case, feel free to [contact me](https://www.nexul.in) if you encounter any issues or have any questions.
